# Line Sorter and Grouper

It sorts selected lines and group them alphabetically. 

## Why

The plugin was developed when my architect required namespace imports to be organizaed, grouped and alaphabetized. The lines sorter plugin was able to sort them alphabetically but it could not group them. So I used the plugin and modified to build the functionality.
